## ❓ FAQ

<details>
<summary><strong>Is it really private and offline?</strong></summary>

Yes! Transcribo runs **entirely on your computer (100% offline)**. Your voice data never leaves your machine. No internet connection is required for transcription.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How accurate is it?</strong></summary>

It uses state-of-the-art AI models (Faster-Whisper based on OpenAI's Whisper), offering human-level accuracy that rivals cloud services like Google Speech-to-Text.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Do I need a GPU?</strong></summary>

A GPU helps significantly with speed, but it's **not required**. Transcribo works on modern CPUs, though transcription will be slower. NVIDIA GPUs with CUDA support provide the best experience.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How is this different from Windows Voice Typing?</strong></summary>

**Privacy and Intelligence**. Standard dictation often sends audio to the cloud and only types *exactly* what you say.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can I use it in any application?</strong></summary>

Yes! Transcribo works **globally**. Whether you're writing in Word, chatting in Discord, coding in VS Code, or posting on Reddit—Transcribo types directly where your cursor is.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What are "Modes"?</strong></summary>

Modes are like "filters" for your voice:
- **Raw**: Types exactly what you say
- **Email**: Turns casual speech into professional emails
- **Notes**: Structured markdown with action items
- **Chat**: Casual messages for social apps
- **Custom**: Create your own! Tell it to "Summarize as a tweet" or "Format as a to-do list"
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What languages are supported?</strong></summary>

Transcribo supports **99+ languages** thanks to its advanced AI engine. It can auto-detect the language or you can set it manually in settings.
</details>
